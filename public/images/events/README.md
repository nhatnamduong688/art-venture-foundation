## 🔄 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Since you have only **1 image**, we will:

1. Upload the single event image as `event-1.jpg`
2. Repeat this image for multiple event cards (4-6 cards)
3. Each card will have:
   - Same image
   - Different event title
   - Different description
   - DETAIL button

This creates a scrollable event list with visual consistency.

---

## 📋 AFTER UPLOAD

Once you upload `event-1.jpg`, I will:

1. Update the Events component to use local image path
2. Create multiple event cards using the same image
3. Implement horizontal scroll
4. Style according to Figma (737x460 cards)
